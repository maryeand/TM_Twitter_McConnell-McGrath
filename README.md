Text Mining Twitter pull with Tweepy

##
The Mitch McConnell txt file is too large to add the the repo but the Amy McGrath file is added as reference.

There are three Python files in this repo. 
1 - "MA_McConnell & McGrath" is the code to pull the data from Twitter. 
2 - "Analyzing the Twitter Data" looks at basic statistics of the text files like number of tokens and lexical diversity.
3 - "Analyzing the Twitter Data Part 2" expands on the descriptive statistics to look at the top words found in the Twitter descriptions for each candidate. It looks at the top 1,000 words as well as just the unique top words between the candidates. Next, I created wordclouds from the unique words based on their frequency. 

The Word document "Text Mining A&A" is a write-up of the descriptive statitsics, top words, and images of the word clouds.
